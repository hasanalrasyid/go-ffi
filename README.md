### Go foreign export implementations for the standard library

This is a fork of [andyarvanitis/purescript-native-go-ffi](https://github.com/andyarvanitis/purescript-native-go-ffi) to support Golang modules.

Note that many values are currently missing. Only a minimum set has been implemented â€“ just beyond enough for the standard compiler tests to pass. Please feel free to contribute any that you have implemented yourself (via a pull request to [andyarvanitis/purescript-native-go-ffi](https://github.com/andyarvanitis/purescript-native-go-ffi)).
